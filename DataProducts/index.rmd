## Developing Data Projects

2/21/2015

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a random number generator and see how random numbers are distributed using a histogram and a scatter plot.

---

## Random Numbers

1. Demonstrate random numbers follows an even distribution.
2. The larger the number of random variables, the more even the distribuion will be.

## Histroram

A histogram is provides a nice graphical representation of the distribution of the data.
---

## Scatter Plot

We see that there is no grouping in any of the random variables and the dots are fairly well scattered.
